## Materi Tentang Sistem Informasi

- Materi tentang [Static Techniques](https://www.slideshare.net/SitiRubayati/static-techniques-83286361)
- Materi tentang [Testing throughout the software life-cycle](https://www.slideshare.net/SitiRubayati/testing-throughout-the-software-life-cycle-83285896)
- Materi tentang [fundamentals of testing](https://www.slideshare.net/SitiRubayati/fundamentals-of-testing-83284797)

Now hop over to [Usage](#usage) to get it running with your own stuff!

**When you publish changes use `git push -u origin master`**

-------------------------


## Setup as standalone project page

- Go click **fork** on the [static techniques](https://www.slideshare.net/SitiRubayati/static-techniques-83286361)
- Rename your new repository to `whatever you want`. (click settings in the right column)
  * It will go live at yourusername.github.io/**WhateverYouWant**
- Clone your repository, cd into the project
- Run `git checkout publish && git branch -D gh-pages && git branch -m gh-pages && git push -uf origin gh-pages` to swap the *publish* and *gh-pages* branch.

**When you publish changes use `git push -u origin gh-pages`**

## Setup inside existing project

This is the most complicated use-case .. but it's the coolest.
Say you've got your kickass project `github.com/t413/kicker` and want to have
some web presence to post about on [hacker news](http://news.ycombinator.com).
This will create an orphan branch called `gh_pages` in your repository
where you can publish changes, posts, images, and such. It won't alter your code at all.

- `cd` into your project on the command line
- use `git remote add -t publish singlepage git@github.com:t413/SinglePaged.git` to get access to this repository.
- use `git fetch singlepage publish:gh-pages` to fetch the remote branch
- use `git branch --set-upstream gh-pages singlepage/publish && git checkout gh-pages;`
  This creates and checks out an orphan branch called gh-pages that tracks the original and lets you make changes.
- When you run `git push gh-pages:origin/gh-pages` it'll be live at *yourusername.github.io/repositoryName*

Now hop over to [Usage](#usage) to get it running with your own stuff!

**When you publish changes use `git push -u origin gh-pages`**
